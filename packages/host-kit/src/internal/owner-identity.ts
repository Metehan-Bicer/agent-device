 * loses under CPU contention) is not proof the owner died, so it never
 * condemns a pid that kill(pid, 0) says is alive. Death is only concluded
 * from positive evidence: the pid is gone or the process is a zombie (already
 * terminated, merely unreaped). A different readable start time proves PID
 * reuse, but remains a distinct result so each ownership policy must decide
 * explicitly whether that proof permits recovery. An unreadable start time is
 * not proof of reuse. An owner recorded without a start time stays fail-closed
 * while its pid is alive: there is no same-clock-domain proof of birth order (wall-clock
 * arithmetic over `ps etime` shifts under clock steps), and misreading a live
 * owner as recycled would let a waiter steal a held resource.
